# Neural Networks for Dengue Fever Prediction

start [here](Example_Neural Network for Dengue Prediction_Brazil cities.ipynb): We use a simple feed-forward neural network architecture, the multilayer perceptron, to predict Dengue in three Brazilian cities.

In [this](Recurrent Neural Networks.ipynb) notebook, we also implement a popular recurrent neural network architecture called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
